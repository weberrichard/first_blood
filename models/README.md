## models
Currently we are using three different models: two for the complete arterial system (Halasz_A50), and Reymond_99), and one for the carotis. 

### Current projects
- *Reymond_99:* updated model with WK3 peripherial models, 0D heart model, and viscoelastic wall property

- *Carotis:* modeling only the neigbourhood of carotis stenosis with 4 arteries, and nonlinear 0D elements
- *Halasz:* former arterial model for previous research with simplified periphery, and upper boundary condition
